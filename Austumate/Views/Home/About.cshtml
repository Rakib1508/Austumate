            <h2>Our Journey</h2>

            <p class="bg-left border-right-0">
                AuStuMate is an idea developed in the collective minds of a few software developers while
                discussing about the tiring processes to gain education throughout the World. Although the
                World has come a long way since the invention of automated systems a few decades back, people
                are not really focused about the slow and traditional styles of management in education sector.
                It is not very productive when our students grow in an environment where everything is managed
                in a traditional way. When these students graduate and enters into the real World, they find
                everything to be very different from the environment which cultured them. Because of this,
                they need extra training for getting accustomed which needs both money and time. With a dream
                to culture the students into a more practical environment with the real World, AuStuMate evolved
                to make the management culture of university education automated keeping in pace with the
                real World so that they can grow in a parallel environment and become more productive.
